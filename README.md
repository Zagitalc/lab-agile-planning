# Lab Agile Planning: A Practical Exercise in Agile Project Management

This repository serves as a practical demonstration and working example of Agile project management principles, specifically utilizing a Kanban-style board for task tracking and progress visualization.  It showcases a typical workflow, from initial issue creation to task completion, within a simulated project environment.  The core focus is on applying user stories, acceptance criteria, and iterative development in a clear and accessible manner.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This repository exemplifies the following core Agile concepts:

*   **User Stories:**  Tasks are defined using the standard "As a [role], I need [function], So that [benefit]" format, emphasizing user-centric development.  (See example template below).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  Each task includes clearly defined acceptance criteria using the "Given-When-Then" format, ensuring unambiguous requirements and testability.
*   **Kanban Board:**  A visual Kanban board (implemented using GitHub Projects) is used to track the progress of tasks through various stages (e.g., "New Issues," "Backlog," "Product Backlog," "Sprint Backlog," "In Progress," "Review/QA," "Done").  This provides transparency and facilitates workflow management.
*   **Iterative Development:** The project structure encourages iterative development, with tasks broken down into manageable units and progress tracked through sprints (although explicit sprint timelines are not rigidly defined in this example).
*   **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues are used as the primary mechanism for defining and managing tasks, including assigning responsibilities, adding labels, and estimating effort.

## User Story Template

The following template is provided as a guideline for creating new user stories within this project:
---
name: User Story
about: This template is for creating user stories
title: ''
labels: ''
assignees: ''

---

**As a** [role]  
 **I need** [function]  
 **So that** [benefit]  
   
 ### Details and Assumptions
 * [document what you know]
   
 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
 ```gherkin
 Given [some context]
 When [certain action is taken]
 Then [the outcome of action is observed]
 ```

# Kanban Board Structure

The Kanban board is organized into the following columns, representing the stages of the development workflow:

1.  **New Issues:**  Newly created issues that have not yet been prioritized or assigned.
2.  **Backlog:** Issues that are deemed valuable but are not yet scheduled for active development.  This is a general backlog.
3.  **Product Backlog:**  A more refined backlog, representing items that are likely to be included in future sprints.
4.  **Sprint Backlog:** Issues selected for active development within a specific sprint (implicitly defined).
5.  **In Progress:** Issues currently being worked on.
6.  **Review/QA:**  Issues that have been completed and are awaiting review or quality assurance testing.
7.  **Done:**  Issues that have been successfully completed and verified.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository can be used in several ways:

*   **Learning Resource:**  Explore the existing issues and the Kanban board to understand how Agile principles are applied in a practical setting.
*   **Template:**  Fork this repository to create your own Agile project, adapting the structure and templates to your specific needs.
*   **Practice:**  Create new issues based on hypothetical scenarios, assign them to yourself or others, and move them through the Kanban board to simulate the Agile workflow.
