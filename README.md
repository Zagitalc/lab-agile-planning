# Lab Agile Planning: A Practical Exercise in Agile Project Management

This repository serves as a practical demonstration and working example of Agile project management principles, specifically utilizing a Kanban-style board for task tracking and progress visualization.  It showcases a typical workflow, from initial issue creation to task completion, within a simulated project environment.  The core focus is on applying user stories, acceptance criteria, and iterative development in a clear and accessible manner.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This repository exemplifies the following core Agile concepts:

*   **User Stories:**  Tasks are defined using the standard "As a [role], I need [function], So that [benefit]" format, emphasizing user-centric development.  (See example template below).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  Each task includes clearly defined acceptance criteria using the "Given-When-Then" format, ensuring unambiguous requirements and testability.
*   **Kanban Board:**  A visual Kanban board (implemented using GitHub Projects) is used to track the progress of tasks through various stages (e.g., "New Issues," "Backlog," "Product Backlog," "Sprint Backlog," "In Progress," "Review/QA," "Done").  This provides transparency and facilitates workflow management.
*   **Iterative Development:** The project structure encourages iterative development, with tasks broken down into manageable units and progress tracked through sprints (although explicit sprint timelines are not rigidly defined in this example).
*   **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues are used as the primary mechanism for defining and managing tasks, including assigning responsibilities, adding labels, and estimating effort.
